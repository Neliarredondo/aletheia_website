# Welcome to the Aletheia HTML5 project!

In this repository, we are practicing and recreating the design of the Aletheia website using HTML5. This is a great opportunity to improve our web development skills and to create a visually appealing and functional website.

Feel free to take a look around and see our progress. We welcome any contributions or suggestions to help us improve the site. Thank you for visiting!
